## Introduction
Pneumonia, a leading cause of mortality worldwide, particularly among children under five, demands timely and accurate diagnosis. Chest X-rays play a vital role, but challenges like overlapping features and inconsistent image quality complicate detection. This project automates pneumonia detection through **deep learning** techniques, aiding radiologists in making faster, more accurate decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the **Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center** and comprises **5,863 pediatric chest X-ray images** categorized into:
- **Normal**
- **Pneumonia**

### Dataset Distribution:
| Set           | Normal | Pneumonia |
|---------------|--------|-----------|
| Training Set  | 1,341  | 3,875     |
| Validation Set| 8      | 8         |
| Test Set      | 234    | 390       |

To address class imbalance, data redistribution and weight adjustments were applied during preprocessing.

## Explainable AI
Transparency is essential in medical AI. This project uses:
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):** Highlights image regions influencing the modelâ€™s decision (red for pneumonia, blue for normal).
- **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations):** Highlights critical regions responsible for predictions using interpretable superpixels.

These tools provide interpretability and build trust in AI systems.
